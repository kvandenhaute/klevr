Maintenance of existing websites that all shared a common codebase.
HLN, 7sur7, De Morgen, AD, Goed Gevoel, Trouw, Parool and Volkskrant.
Occasionally new features were implemented like Napoleon Games, FIFA World Cup 2014 support, â€¦
But most of the time it was fixing existing bugs and refactor code to prevent production issues.
