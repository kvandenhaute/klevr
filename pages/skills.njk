I'm not fond of judging my skills using a number from 1 to 10. I think it's really hard to do.
Can you ever be a 10? It depends on what you expect. In the next ratings a 10 means that if
you give a problem in that specific area, I will be able to solve it if it can be solved. If
I don't know it immediately I'm still able to find it.
