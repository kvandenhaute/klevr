<p>Digipolis Gent was looking for a Symfony 2 developer for a short term project.
An internal department of pest controllers was in desperate need of digitization.
Until then everything was done on paper, and someone at the administration kept
records of it on a computer. Thanks to the application the pest controllers could use an
iPad to enter the information, and the administration could create / update appointments,
get statistics, â€¦ Within two monts I've built it using the Symfony 2 framework,
Twitter Bootstrap, some jQuery magic and an integration with Outlook to update the pest
controllers calendars. They even won an award with it from the city of Gent.</p>
