<p>Develop-it is my first professional experience. It's a small web development company creating
and maintaining websites for businesses in the area of Gent. My main job was developing inside
Dokeos (LMS &amp; E-learning Suite) and KlasCement (a website made by and for teachers to exchange
learning material). Both use PHP as main scripting language. Sometimes I had to develop inside
Moodle, Joomla or Mambo.</p>
