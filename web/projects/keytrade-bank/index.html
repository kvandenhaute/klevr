<p>At Keytrade Bank my main job was developing in PHP. Our web team had to maintain three websites.
The public site with all the information about the Keytrade products, the secure site where
customers are able to do all kind of transactions and at last the intranet site where coworkers
could manage all the customers information, product information, â€¦ Beside PHP I also did the
visual part of the websites. So HTML, CSS and JavaScript was also part of the job. I had a
wonderful time at Keytrade Bank and I still have contact with some ex-coworkers.</p>
