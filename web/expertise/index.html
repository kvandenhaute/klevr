<h3>HTML &amp; CSS</h3>
<p>Creating mobile first layouts using the BEM methodology and following the W3C standards. From simple layouts up to the most advanced ones using the latest techniques without forgetting about supporting the stupid not so smart browsers.</p>
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>The less the better. My number one goal when building a website is to make everything work without JavaScript, and then enhance it. Progressive Enhancement. Make it performant, secure and clean. Make it work.</p>
<h3>PHP &amp; MySQL</h3>
<p>My go to scripting language for personal projects that need to be dynamic. I used to build everything myself, but in the meantime I am klevr enough to use the Symfony framework. When I need a database, I go for MySQL. PHP and MySQL grew up together, it's a (cheap) killer combination.</p>
<h3>Build systems</h3>
<p>I am a good developer. So I am a lazy developer. A good build system helps me being lazy. Gulp. Save a file, and the system takes care of it. Sass is compiled into CSS. JavaScript tests run. SVG icons are transformed into an iconfont. Images are optimized. Browser refreshes. I can work so much faster, and there is always checking someone if my HTML, CSS and JavaScript is by the rules. Love it.</p>
<h3>Agile</h3>
<p>Scrum. Kanban. Sprints. Daily stand-up. Retrospective. Product backlog. Product owner. Planning. Ok, enough. I know my way around Agile. I know what it takes to complete a sprint, and what the flow is. I do it on a daily base at work and I'm planning to do it at home too when I have kids.</p>
<h3>Test Driven Development</h3>
<p>Yes, I test my code. It's not the most awesome thing to do, but it helps a lot during development. When writing code you don't want to spend time going through the same scenarios over and over again to see if everything still works. No, you write some good tests that do all that for you. If your tests cover all possible scenarios, the end to end testing is a breeze. You can focus more on UI and other details. Don't get me wrong, you should still check all the written scenarios yourself, but it will go much faster.</p>
<h3>The Need for Speed</h3>
<p>No, I don't mean the video game. Or the movie. Although I played the NFS video games a lot. What I really mean is the performance of websites. Use a properly configuration for delivering static resources, gzip, caching headers, â€¦ It's impressive how so little changes can have such a massive effect. Last time I checked this current site had a 97 speed score on Google PageSpeed, and that's without the critical CSS part that I'm working on. It can mean the difference between a visitor that left the site before it was loaded because he was on a bad connection, and that same visitor who becomes a client after a succesful page visit.</p>
