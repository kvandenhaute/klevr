Hi, I'm Kevin. Passionate web developer, enthusiast LEGO builder (AFOL1), gadget freak and
occasionally sporty too. Happily maried, and living in the Brussels area.

Since the age of 152 I'm passionated by the web. I had my first PC at the same age. It didn't
take too long or I was building my first website in Microsoft FrontPage. Black background,
limegreen text in Comic Sans MS and animated gifs overload. Those were the days. To make it
public I used the well known Geocities.

As funny as it sounds now, back then it was a big deal for me. I created something that someone
else at the other end of the world could see. How cool is that! So I knew what to do. Work hard
to become an IT scientist. I was blessed. Some of us still don't know what they really want to do
for a living, and I was 15 and I knew it.

People grow up. So do I. Started with a PC, evolved into Linux and became adult with a Mac. I
find my way around all three of those systems, but my experience is that you can achieve so much
more in less time with a Mac.

### So, what am I?
Good question. In the world of web we are at a point that no one can be good at all. So I made
some choices based on experiences. I am a very good frontend developer. HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Am I the best? No. But I work hard to become the best. No day passes or I'm looking into new or
existing techniques to become a better developer. I also am a good PHP developer. Not as good as
frontend, but more than good enough to be part of your PHP developers team. PHP is my first love
when it comes to dynamic websites.

### And what am I not?
Easy. I'm not a Java developer. I still know some things or two from the time I was learning it
at school, and I have some work experience many years ago. So I can do small changes when I need
to. But I do not have the pretense to call myself a Java developer. I am also not a .NET, C or
Objective-C developer. So please don't contact me for such opportunities. You are wasting both
our times.

I do not design either. Yes, I know my way around color usage, and yes I know how a good website
looks like. But I don't do advanced designs. It's about getting the right people for the job, and
I'm not a designer. I implement designs. Big difference.

### But I want to be â€¦
I'm very interested in React Native, so that's what I'm currently learning. You can say it's too
early to hire me for a React Native opportunity, or it must be that you can give me the time at
the job to grow with it. I am a fast learner, and I have a great JavaScript background. It's
totally up to you.
