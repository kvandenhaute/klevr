My first client as a freelance developer. They hired me for updating some existing ATM screens.
Those screens are driven by JavaScript to handle the interactions and pass through the commands
given by the client to the backend. There is a custom framework that is used for all clients, and
the possibility to adapt some features for each client. I worked mainly on the client feature side,
not on the framework. For some changes I had to use my HTML and CSS skills too, but that was very
basic.
